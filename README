= Goals =

This script can convert bank statements from mBank and Unicredit bank
into QIF file format that can be processed by KMyMoney and some other
financial software.

If you can provide additional bank statement converters I'll gladly
add them.

This was originally mbank2qif, but was renamed after addition of
Unicredit converter. See https://github.com/sochotnicky/mbank2qif for
history

= Usage =
$ ./bank2qif.py -h
usage: bank2qif.py [-h] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT] [-t TYPE]

Bank statement to QIF file converter

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        input file to process [default:stdin]
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output file [default:stdout]
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Type of input file [default:mbank] Possible values:

The way it's designed (using stdin/out) it can be used as KMyMoney
import filter.
